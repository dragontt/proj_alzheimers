This project serves as an automated parallelized solution for cerebral vascular network extraction and vasculature analysis. The ultimate goal is to understand the physiological process and disorder of Alzheimer's disease progression over time. Vascular network extraction is essential in identifying the axis of blood flow pathways and their connectivity, as well as characterizing the morpholgy of stalled vs normal vessel segments. Plug extraction and analysis serves as another set of automated tools to portray the relationship between beta-amyloid plaque and stalled location. 

### Vascular Extraction

- 

### Vascular Analysis

- Fixes plist structure, skeleton alignment and shift to vasculature image stack;
- Segments vasculature; 
- Computes vascular morphology, and analyzes statistics;
- Computes the shortest path from stalled vessel to penetrating artery (PA) and ascending vein (AV) respectively, and analyzes statistics;
- Computes tissue volume corresponding to its nearest vasculature
